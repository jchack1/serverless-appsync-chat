other tasks:

- migrate js functions to ts
- consider reorganizing folder structure so it is more clear where functions and resolvers are - DONE
- update addNewChat to return the chat to frontend, then update frontend to put new chat in chatlist -DONE

possible future backend tasks:

- create functionality to delete, update members/messages - and implement on frontend
- consider adding monitoring, so I can see if the app/my account in general is being used, if I deploy the app to Amplify
