possible future front-end tasks:

- notification sound on receipt of new message
- notification icon on chatlist on receipt of new message (if chat not currently open)
- list chats in order of newest message
- is there a better way to make chat container more responsive than having many media queries?
- unsend/edit message
- delete chat from list
