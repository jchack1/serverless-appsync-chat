to-do:

- clean-up typescript: converted frontend to typescript, but room for improvement. See if I can reorganize anything, make types more strict, update instances of "any" where possible

other future front-end tasks:

- notification sound on receipt of new message
- notification icon on chatlist on receipt of new message (if chat not currently open)
- list chats in order of newest message
- is there a better way to make chat container more responsive than having many media queries?
- unsend/edit message
- delete chat from list
